I am a Doctoral Researcher at **Saarland University** and a member of **ELLIS**, working with **Prof. Vera Demberg**.

My research focuses on evaluating and improving the reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs). I am specifically interested in understanding the fundamental limitations of LLM architectures through expressivity frameworks and mechanistic interpretability and fixing them to improve LLMs' reliability in practice.

Previously, I completed my Masters in Computational Linguistics at the **University of Tübingen**, where I worked with **Prof. Detmar Meurers** and **Dr. Çağrı Çöltekin**. Before that, I worked as a Research Assistant at **IIT Madras** with **Prof. Mitesh Khapra**.

Outside of the lab, I also help start-ups integrate GenAI into their products. In my free time, I enjoy hiking and reading poetry. I have been learning to play Violin for about a year now.

P.S. If you find me with my violin in my hand, you might want to look for some earplugs ;P
