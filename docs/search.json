    "text": "I am a Doctoral Researcher at Saarland University and a member of ELLIS, working with Prof. Vera Demberg.\nMy research focuses on evaluating the reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs). I am specifically interested in understanding the limitations of both the underlying architecture & training recipes and fixing them to improve LLMs’ reliability in practice.\nPreviously, I completed my Masters in Computational Linguistics at the University of Tübingen, where I worked with Prof. Detmar Meurers and Dr. Çağrı Çöltekin. Before that, I worked as a Research Assistant at IIT Madras with Prof. Mitesh Khapra.\nOutside of the lab, I also help start-ups integrate GenAI into their products. In my free time, I enjoy hiking and reading poetry. I have been learning to play Violin for about a year now.\nP.S. If you find me with my violin in my hand, you might want to look for some earplugs ;P"
