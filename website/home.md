## A little about me

I am now a student at University of Tübingen, pursuing my masters in Computational Linguistics. I am currently working on a Question Generation problem.
<!-- I am now working on solving a Fact-Checking problem and exploring Deep Unsupervised Learning (CS-294). -->

<!-- Previously, I worked as a Research Assistant at IIIT-D. Before that, I worked at Aruba, A Hewlett Packard Enterprise company, as a Cloud Engineer. -->

[comment]: <> (I completed my bachelor's studies from Ahmedabad University, where I worked in the Data Analytics and Cloud Computing Lab. My area of focus is mainly in Machine Learning and its applications, primarily in Natural Language Processing.)

When I am not busy doing research, I generally try to go for a nice hike. I also love to read and write* poetry. 

#### P.S. If you find me looking for my flute, you might want to look for headphones ;P
